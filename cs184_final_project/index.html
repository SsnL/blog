    <h2 align="middle">Project Abstract</h2>
      <p>In this project, we aim to support fluid simulation and display the simulated result with rendering algorithms. Fluid simulation is widely used by artists and producers in providing amazing visual effects. It's also used in engineering area in studying fluid dynamics. However, fluid movement follows complicated physical models and thus requires a huge number of computations to simulate. Futhermore, fluid rendering takes relatively long time. Thus, efficient simulation and rendering of fluid are interesting topics and become our final project ideas.</p>
      <p>We implement this project in C++ based on <a href="http://cs184.eecs.berkeley.edu/cs184_sp16/article/10">this assignment</a> as starting code. The start code implements a keyboard controlled ray tracing UI with both visualization mode and rendering function. Thus, we can simply add fluid simulation and rendering to the starting code to test its functionality in different background settings.</p>
      <p>We also proposed to implement subsurface scattering to fluid in the beginning. However, unless water is super dirty, water simply refracts light. Thus, subsurface scattering becomes unnecessary, so we removed it from our final project proposal.</p>
      <p>Here is a GIF of our final rendered result.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, our GIF images do not preserve details of original png pictures. But they nicely reprent  simulated fluid flow. </p>

    <h3 align="left">Algorithm Overview</h2>
        <p>We follow the algorithm from <a href="http://mmacklin.com/pbf_sig_preprint.pdf">Position Based Fluids</a> in fluid simulation. This is a particle-based approach. Here is an overview of the algorithm. At each time step, <ol>
            <li>Update each particle's position and velocity according to its current velocity and the forces acting on it. </li>
            <li>Estimate each particle <code>i</code>'s density <code>rho_i</code> using a smoothing kernel over all its neighbors (SPH estimate). </li>
            <li>To achieve a rest density <code>rho_0</code>, for each particle <code>i</code>, apply a constraint <code>C_i = rho_i / rho_0 - 1</code>, and solve for position updates along the gradient of <code>C_i</code> using Newton's method. Perform collision detection and response if necessary. </li>
            <li>Update velocity using the position change in this timestep. </li>
            <li>Apply vorticity confinement and XSPH viscosity. </li>
        </ol></p>
        <p>Notice that each particle is constraint by its constraint as well as its neighbors' constraints. It is not practical to satisfy all the constraints, thus we use <a href="http://ode-wiki.org/wiki/index.php?title=Manual:_Concepts#Constraint_Force_Mixing_.28CFM.29">constraint force mixing (CFM)</a> to softly mix the constraints together. </p>
        <p>The SPH density estimate becomes unstable near the fluid-air boundary due to lacking enough neighboring particles. An artificial pressure term is added to prevent particles clumping. The vorticity confinement and XSPH viscosity steps are used to account for energy loss and maintain coherent motion. <p>

        </div>
    <h3 align="left">Collision Detection and Response</h2>
        <p>Handling collision isn't an easy thing in scenes with objects. Initially, we simply cast a ray from the particle's starting position along its update direction. If an intersection happens, the particle is only moved to the intersection point on the surface of the colliding object. </p>
        <div align="center">
            <table style="width=100%">
                <tr>

                </tr>
            </table>
        </div>
        <p>However, imagine a particle landing on the surface as shown above. At each timestep, it tries to move down due to gravity, by it will always hit the same surface and get stuck there forever. </p>
        <div align="center">
            <table style="width=100%">
                <tr>

                </tr>
            </table>
        </div>
        <p>In real life, if a rain drop hits a surface, it should either bounce off or slide along the surface, depending the velocity, angle, and surface material. To not overly complicate the problem, we choose to simply let the particle slide along the intersecting surface to solve above issue. </p>

    <h3 align="left">Parameter Tuning</h2>
        <p>Parameter tuning was a huge pain. Most of the parameter values suggested in the paper don't work well in our case, probably due to different scene sizes. It is also important how to set the rest density. A low rest density would cause an exploding effect. Yet a high rest density would cause the particles flow really slow (like mercury in real life). </p>
        <div align="center">
            <table style="width=100%">

        </div>
    <h2 align="middle">Part 2: Surfacing and rendering</h2>
        To get a more realistic rendering of the fluid, we want to convert the particles into triangle meshes. We investigated several algorithms for surfacing including computing the convex hull and screen space fluid rendering described in
        <a href="http://developer.download.nvidia.com/presentations/2010/gdc/Direct3D_Effects.pdf">this paper</a>. We finally choose Marching Cube describe in
        <a href="http://paulbourke.net/geometry/polygonise/">this article</a> because works the best with our existing implementation of pathtracer and fluid simulator.
        <h3 align="left">Surfacing: Marching Cube</h3>
        Marching Cube is an algorithm for creating a polygonal representation an isosurface on a 3D scalar field. The 3D scalar field is defined as a function and denotes how far the point is from the particles. As shown below, the algorithm will give us a polygonal surface of the fluid particles.
        <div align="center">
            <table style="width=100%">
                  <tr>
                      <td align="middle">
                      <img src="images/isosurface.png" width="480px" />
                      <figcaption align="middle">Black dots denote vertices that's smaller than the chosen isolevel</figcaption>
                  </tr>
            </table>
        </div>
        The main idea of Marching Cube is dividing the space into tiny cubes and use a configuration of triangular surfaces according to the scalar values at each cube's 8 vertices. The specific positions of points on edges are linearly interpolated according to the scalar values on both ends of the edge.
        <div align="center">
          <table style="width=100%">
              <tr>
                  <td align="middle">
                  <img src="images/marching_cube.gif" width="480px" />
                  <figcaption align="middle">Black dots denote vertices that's smaller than the chosen isolevel</figcaption>
              </tr>
          </table>
        </div>

        <h3 align="left">Isofield function</h3>
        Now the problem is how do we define the isofield function so that the closer we're to the particles, the higher value we get. At first, we thought of using the distance to the closest fluid particle as the isofield function. However, this involves implementing the nearest neighbor search.
        <br>
        Then we find out that the densities defined during fluid simulation is conveniently available as isofields. Another plus is that paramter tuning becomes easier. We use the rest density as the threshod isolevel and half of kernel radius as the maximum cube size.

    <h2 align="middle">Features</h2>
        <p>We implemented some nice features to help us debug as well as make the program more user-friendly: <ol>
            <li>Command line option <code>-p [xml filename]</code> imports a particle file with initial position, initial velocity, and rest density. </li>
            <li>Command line option <code>-d [int simulation time]</code> starts simulation and rendering windowlessly and saves the rendered png files. </li>

    <h2 align="middle">Lessons Learned and Future Work</h2>
      <p>One lesson we learned is that debugging with visualization helps a lot. For example, coloring the particles in colors proportional to their density helps us debug the fluid simulation algorithm. We also learned various surfacing and rendering techniques such as marching cubes and screen space rendering.</p>
      <p>For future work, one thing we can work on is to use advanced surfacing techniques to smooth the surface that marching cube method generates. We can see that the air bubbles in fluid are not rendered perfectly for now and smoothing the surface can improve on this part. We can also apply parallelized computing or GPU techniques to speed up the rendering work. Moreover, we can also work on interactive fluid simulation such as moving the fluid particles to a certain position by interactive control. Finally, to render dusty water nicely, we may also work on volumetric rendering.</p>
