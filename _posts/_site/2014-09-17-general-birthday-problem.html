<p>Assume that everyone’s birthday is uniformly distributed in 365 days of a year. What is the probability that no two people have birthdays with difference less than or equal to <script type="math/tex">k</script> days among <script type="math/tex">n</script> people?</p>

<h2 id="solution">Solution:</h2>

<p>If <script type="math/tex">n(k + 1) > 365</script>, the probability is clearly 0.</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\mathbb{P} = 0</script>

<p>If <script type="math/tex">k = 0</script>, the problem degenerates into the classic birthday problem. The solution is as follows.</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\mathbb{P} = \frac{365!}{365^n \cdot (365 - k + 1)!}</script>

<p>Otherwise, we number the 365 days as <script type="math/tex">d_i</script>, <script type="math/tex">i \in \{1, \cdots, 365\}</script> and divide the problem into two cases:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>No one is born during <script type="math/tex">\{d_{365-k+1}, \cdots, d_{365}\}</script>.</p>

    <p>Let the $n$ people be <script type="math/tex">P_i</script>, <script type="math/tex">i \in \{1, \cdots, n\}</script>. Then we combine each <script type="math/tex">P_i</script>’s  birthday with the <script type="math/tex">k</script> days right after it. Then we have <script type="math/tex">n</script> combined elements and <script type="math/tex">365 - n(k + 1)</script> days. The problem transforms into picking $n$ days from a row of <script type="math/tex">365 - nk</script> days and replacing them with our <script type="math/tex">n</script> combined elements.</p>

    <p>We have <script type="math/tex">n! {365 - nk \choose n} = (365 - nk)_n</script> possible cases each with equal probability.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Someone is born during <script type="math/tex">\{d_{365 - k + 1}, \cdots, d_{365}\}</script>.</p>

    <p>Apparently, no two people can both have birthdays in that range. Therefore, the problem becomes how to put $n - 1$ people’s birthdays in the rest <script type="math/tex">365 - k - 1</script> days.</p>

    <p>Notice that this situation is different with the situation in the problem where the 365 days form a cycle. So, using the method in the first case, We have <script type="math/tex">(n - 1)! {365 - k - 1 - (n - 1)k \choose n - 1} = (365 - nk - 1)_{n - 1}</script> possible cases each with equal probability.</p>

    <p>However, we have <script type="math/tex">365 - (365 - k + 1) + 1 = k</script> days and <script type="math/tex">n</script> people to choose from. Therefore, there are <script type="math/tex">nk \cdot (365 - nk - 1)_{n - 1}</script> cases in total.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Each case is of probability <script type="math/tex">\frac{1}{365^n}</script>. So the probability that no two people have birthdays with difference less than or equal to <script type="math/tex">k</script> days among <script type="math/tex">n</script> people is</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\mathbb{P} = \frac{(365 - nk)_n + nk \cdot (365 - nk - 1)_{n - 1}}{365^n}</script>

<p>By inspecting the formula, we find out that it also works for the first two cases. Therefore, this formula give correct answer for all cases.</p>
