Hello there!

I am Tongzhou Wang (also go by the name Simon), a second-year undergraduate student at the great UC Berkeley. As a person who enjoys engineering and humanity, I am having fun with my majors, computer science and statistics, as well as my intended minor, philosophy. In late 2014, I was a software intern at Sellegit Inc, where I worked on website backend as well as an Android app, [Peach](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=peach.fdroid). Currently, I am doing undergraduate research with [Professor Stuart Russell](http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~russell/) at UC Berkeley.

My fields of interests include:

+ Artificial intelligence
+ Machine learning
+ Data science
+ Natural language processing
+ Computer vision
+ Information theory
+ Computation theory
+ Probability theory
+ and many more!

As for hobbies, I have been playing soccer for 10 years. I am also a not bad Magic player. :P

Please find my resume [here]({{ site.url }}/about/resume/).

Random facts:

+ My favorite font is Palatino.
+ I play saxophone starting from middle school.
+ I have a cute 8-year-old young brother.
+ Chinese food in China is way better than Chinese food here.
+ I really enjoy Markdown!

Hope you enjoy it.
