Hello there!

I am Tongzhou Wang (also go by the name Simon), a third-year undergraduate student at UC Berkeley. As a person who enjoys engineering and humanity, I am having fun with my majors, computer science and statistics, as well as my intended minor, philosophy. 

In summer 2015, I was a software engineer intern at Facebook Inc., where I helped implementing a unified logging framework as well as built internal debugging tools and services based on the logging schema. In addition, I am also doing undergraduate research with [Professor Stuart Russell](http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~russell/) on adaptive MCMC algorithm in first-order inference.

My fields of interests include:

+ Artificial intelligence
+ Machine learning
+ Data science
+ Natural language processing
+ Computer vision
+ Algortihms
+ Information theory
+ Computation theory
+ Probability theory
+ and many more!

As for hobbies, I have been playing soccer for 10 years. I am also a not bad Magic:the Gathering player. :P

Please find my résumé [here]({{ site.url }}/about/resume/).

Random fun facts:

+ My favorite font is Palatino.
+ I play saxophone starting from middle school.
+ I have a cute 9-year-old young brother.
+ Chinese food in China is way better than Chinese food here.
+ I really enjoy Markdown!

Hope you enjoy it.
