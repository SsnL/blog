Hello there!

I am Simon, a second-year undergraduate student at the great UC Berkeley. As a person who enjoys engineering and humanity, I am having fun with my majors, computer science and statistics, as well as my intended minor, philosophy. Other than that, I am currently a software intern at Sellegit Inc.

My fields of interests include:

+ Artificial intelligence
+ Machine learning
+ Algorithms
+ Natural language processing
+ Computer vision
+ Information theory
+ Computation theory
+ Probability theory
+ and many more!

As for hobbies, I have played soccer for 10 years. I am also a not bad Magic player. :P
